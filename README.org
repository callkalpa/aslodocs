#+TITLE: Sugar activities documentation
#+AUTHOR: Bastien Guerry

* Why?

The purpose of this repository is to gather documentation about Sugar
activities in http://activities.sugarlabs.org.

Use a new directory for each new activity.

In this directory, use whatever plain text format you want to gather bits
of documentation you may find on the Sugar Labs wiki or on other web pages.

- http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Activities#Sugar_Activities
- http://academy.one-education.org/mod/book/view.php?id=130

* What for?

The purpose of this repository is to be a staging area for getting an
overview of the available documentation, and the work needed for adding
documentation directly in each Sugar Activity.

* Be bold!

Don't bother about the format yet.  Use plain text when possible, light
markup if possible, copy-paste from wikis, whatever.
